   abstract = {The use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy is standard care in the management of patients with various malignancies including ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. PARP inhibitors have been approved in different settings for patients with specific hereditary pathogenic variants, most notably homologous recombination repair pathways such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The vast experience with PARP inhibitors (olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib) has been in the management of epithelial ovarian cancer. There have not been any head-to-head comparisons of PARP inhibitors in randomized trials, and we can only perform cross-comparison on the basis of the reported literature. The three approved PARP inhibitors share several common adverse effects because of a class effect including nausea, fatigue, and anemia, but there are notable differences likely because of variations in their poly-pharmacology and off-target effects. Finally, patients included in clinical trials are often younger with a good performance status and less comorbidities than the real-world population, and hence, the potential benefits and adverse effects may not be superimposable. In this review, we describe these differences and discuss strategies to mitigate and manage adverse side effects effectively.},

   abstract = {Motivation: DNA methylation is an intensely studied epigenetic mark, yet its functional role is incompletely understood. Attempts to quantitatively associate average DNA methylation to gene expression yield poor correlations outside of the well-understood methylation-switch at CpG islands. Results: Here, we use probabilistic machine learning to extract higher order features associated with the methylation profile across a defined region. These features quantitate precisely notions of shape of a methylation profile, capturing spatial correlations in DNA methylation across genomic regions. Using these higher order features across promoter-proximal regions, we are able to construct a powerful machine learning predictor of gene expression, significantly improving upon the predictive power of average DNA methylation levels. Furthermore, we can use higher order features to cluster promoter-proximal regions, showing that five major patterns of methylation occur at promoters across different cell lines, and we provide evidence that methylation beyond CpG islands may be related to regulation of gene expression. Our results support previous reports of a functional role of spatial correlations in methylation patterns, and provide a mean to quantitate such features for downstream analyses.

   abstract = {Importance: Although the activity of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib (the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved immunotherapy for mismatch repair proficient endometrial cancer [MMRP EC]) is compelling, there are no biomarkers of response and most patients do not tolerate, do not respond to, or develop resistance to this regimen, highlighting the need for additional, potentially biomarker-driven therapeutic approaches for patients with recurrent MMRP EC. Objective: To assess the potential positive outcomes and safety of the combination of the polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitor talazoparib and the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor avelumab in recurrent MMRP EC. Design, Settings, and Participants: This investigator-initiated, open-label, single-arm, 2-stage, phase 2 study nonrandomized controlled trial patients at 4 institutions in the US. Key eligibility criteria included measurable disease, unlimited prior therapies, and all endometrial cancer histologies. Interventions: Talazoparib, 1 mg, orally, daily, and avelumab, 10 mg/kg, intravenously, every 2 weeks, were administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Main Outcomes and Measures: Statistical considerations were developed for 2 coprimary objectives of objective response rate and rate of progression-free survival at 6 months, with a 2-stage design that allowed for early discontinuation for futility. Prespecified exploratory objectives included the association of immunogenomic features (determined by targeted-panel next-generation sequencing and immunohistochemistry) with activity. Results: Thirty-five female patients (mean [SD] age, 67.9 [8.41] years) received protocol therapy; 9 (25.7%) derived clinical benefit after meeting at least 1 of the 2 coprimary end points. Four patients (11.4%) exhibited confirmed objective response rates (4 partial responses), and 8 (22.9%) survived progression free at 6 months. The most common grade 3 and 4 treatment-related toxic effects were anemia (16 [46%]), thrombocytopenia (10 [29%]), and neutropenia (4 [11%]); no patient discontinued receipt of therapy because of toxic effects. Tumors with homologous recombination repair alterations were associated with clinical benefit from treatment with avelumab and talazoparib. Tumor mutational burden, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and PD-L1 status were not associated with clinical benefit. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this nonrandomized controlled trial suggest that treatment with avelumab and talazoparib demonstrated a favorable toxic effect profile and met the predetermined criteria to be considered worthy of further evaluation in MMRP EC. Immunogenomic profiling provided insights that may inform ongoing and future studies of polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase and PD-L1 inhibitor combinations in endometrial cancer.

   abstract = {Purpose: CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are key mediators of antitumor immunity and are strongly associated with survival in virtually all solid tumors. However, the prognostic effect of CD8+ TIL is markedly higher in the presence of CD20+ B cells, suggesting that cooperative interactions between these lymphocyte subsets lead to more potent antitumor immunity. Experimental Design: We assessed the colocalization patterns, phenotypes, and gene expression profiles of tumor-associated T-and B-lineage cells in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) by multicolor IHC, flow cytometry, and bioinformatic analysis of gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Results: T cells and B cells colocalized in four types of lymphoid aggregate, ranging from small, diffuse clusters to large, wellorganized tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) resembling activated lymph nodes. TLS were frequently surrounded by dense infiltrates of plasma cells (PC), which comprised up to 90% of tumor stroma. PCs expressed mature, oligoclonal IgG transcripts, indicative of antigen-specific responses. PCs were associated with the highest levels of CD8+, CD4+, and CD20+ TIL, as well as numerous cytotoxicity-related gene products. CD8+ TIL carried prognostic benefit only in the presence of PCs and these other TIL subsets. PCs were independent of mutation load, BRCA1/2 status, and differentiation antigens but positively associated with cancer-testis antigens. Conclusions: PCs are associated with the most robust, prognostically favorable CD8+ TIL responses in HGSC. We propose that TLS facilitate coordinated antitumor responses involving the combined actions of cytolytic T cells and antibody-producing PCs.},

The mechanism of innate immune sensing of immunogenic tumors leading to adaptive Tcell responses remains undefined, although type I interferons (IFNs) are implicated in this process. We found that spontaneous CD8+ Tcell priming against tumors was defective in mice lacking stimulator of interferon genes complex (STING), but not other innate signaling pathways, suggesting involvement of a cytosolic DNA sensing pathway. Invitro, IFN-β production and dendritic cell activation were triggered by tumor-cell-derived DNA, via cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), STING, and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). In the tumor microenvironment invivo, tumor cell DNA was detected within host antigen-presenting cells, which correlated with STING pathway activation and IFN-β production. Our results demonstrate that a major mechanism for innate immune sensing of cancer occurs via the host STING pathway, with major implications for cancer immunotherapy.},

   abstract = {Ionizing radiation-mediated tumor regression depends on type I interferon (IFN) and the adaptive immune response, but several pathways control I IFN induction. Here, we demonstrate that adaptor protein STING, but not MyD88, is required for type I IFN-dependent antitumor effects of radiation. In dendritic cells (DCs), STING was required for IFN-β induction in response to irradiated-tumor cells. The cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) mediated sensing of irradiated-tumor cells in DCs. Moreover, STING was essential for radiation-induced adaptive immune responses, which relied on type I IFN signaling on DCs. Exogenous IFN-β treatment rescued the cross-priming bycGAS or STING-deficient DCs. Accordingly, activation of STING by a second messenger cGAMP administration enhanced antitumor immunity induced by radiation. Thus radiation-mediated antitumor immunity in immunogenic tumors requires a functional cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and suggests that cGAMP treatment might provide a new strategy to improve radiotherapy.},

   abstract = {Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the three most prevalent gynecological tumors affecting women and is the most prevalent gynecological malignancy in the developed world. Its incidence is rapidly increasing worldwide, mostly affecting postmenopausal women, whereas recently its prevalence has increased in younger people. EC is an immune gene disease and many studies have shown that the tumor-immunosuppressive microenvironment plays an important role in cancer progression. In recent years, findings regarding the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITME) of EC have included immune evasion mechanisms and immunotherapy, which are mostly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for EC. Recently studies on the ITME of different molecular types of EC have found that different molecular types may have different ITME. With the research on the immune microenvironment of EC, a new immunophenotype classification based on the immune microenvironment has been carried out in recent years. However, the impact of the ITME on EC remains unclear, and the immunophenotype of EC remains limited to the research stage. Our review describes recent findings regarding the ITME features of different EC molecular types. The advent of immunotherapy has brought hope for improved efficacy and prognosis in patients with advanced or recurrent EC. The efficacy and safety of ICIs combination therapy remains the focus of future research.},

We report efficacy and safety outcomes for patients with MSI-H/dMMR endometrial cancer enrolled in KEYNOTE-158. METHODS Eligible patients from cohorts D (endometrial cancer, regardless of MSI-H/dMMR status) and K (any MSI-H/dMMR solid tumor, except colorectal) with previously treated, advanced MSI-H/dMMR endometrial cancer received pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks for 35 cycles. The primary end point was objective response rate per RECIST version 1.1 by independent central radiologic review. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. RESULTS As of October 5, 2020, 18 of 90 treated patients (20%) had completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab and 52 (58%) had discontinued treatment. In the efficacy population (patients who received $ 1 dose of pembrolizumab and had $ 26 weeks of follow-up; N 5 79), the median time from first dose to data cutoff was 42.6 (range, 6.4-56.1) months. The objective response rate was 48% (95% CI, 37 to 60), and median duration of response was not reached (2.9-49.71 months). Median progression-free survival was 13.1 (95% CI, 4.3 to 34.4) months, and median overall survival was not reached (95% CI, 27.2 months to not reached). Among all treated patients, 76% had $ 1 treatment-related adverse event (grades 3-4, 12%). There were no fatal treatment-related events. Immune-mediated adverse events or infusion reactions occurred in 28% of patients (grades 3-4, 7%; no fatal events).

   abstract = {PURPOSE Genomes of tumors that are deficient in DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) have high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and harbor hundreds to thousands of somatic mutations that encode potential neoantigens. Such tumors are therefore likely to be immunogenic, triggering upregulation of immune checkpoint proteins. Pembrolizumab, an anti‒programmed death-1 monoclonal antibody, has antitumor activity against MSI-H/ dMMR cancer. We report data from the phase II KEYNOTE-158 study of pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated, advanced noncolorectal MSI-H/dMMR cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed MSI-H/dMMR advanced noncolorectal cancer who experienced failure with prior therapy received pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks for 2 years or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. Radiologic imaging was performed every 9 weeks for the first year of therapy and every 12 weeks thereafter. The primary end point was objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, as assessed by independent central radiologic review. RESULTS Among 233 enrolled patients, 27 tumor types were represented, with endometrial, gastric, cholangiocarcinoma, and pancreatic cancers being the most common. Median follow up was 13.4 months. Objective response rate was 34.3% (95% CI, 28.3% to 40.8%). Median progression-free survival was 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.9 months) and median overall survival was 23.5 months (95% CI, 13.5 months to not reached). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 151 patients (64.8%). Thirty-four patients (14.6%) had grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events. Grade 5 pneumonia occurred in one patient; there were no other treatment-related fatal adverse events. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrates the clinical benefit of anti–programmed death-1 therapy with pembrolizumab among patients with previously treated unresectable or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR noncolorectal cancer. Toxicity was consistent with previous experience of pembrolizumab monotherapy.},

   abstract = {In recent years, it has become evident that tumor cells have immune escape mechanisms, and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody) has shown benefit in various cancers. In endometrial tumors with microsatelliteinstability (MSI), somatic mutations have the potential to encode ''non-self'' immunogenic antigens, and lymphocytes have been shown to infiltrate the tumor. Therefore, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy might be effective in endometrial cancers with MSI. Expression of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6), the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8+), and PD-1/PD-L1 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 149 patients with endometrial cancer. We examined whether tumors with MSI had an enhanced immune microenvironment and whether MSI could be a predictor of the therapeutic effect of PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in endometrial cancer. Loss of MMR protein expression was identified in 42 (28.2%) of 149 patients (MSI group) with endometrial cancer. There was no significant relationship between MSI status and age (p = 0.193), histological grade (p = 0.097), FIGO stage (p = 0.508), pelvic lymph node metastasis (p = 0.139), or depth of myometrial invasion (p = 0.494). However, the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8+) and PD-L1/PD-1 expression were significantly higher in the MSI group compared to the microsatellite-stable group (p = 0.002, p = 0.001, and p = 0.008, respectively). These results suggest that immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody) could be effective in endometrial cancers with MSI. The presence of MSI may be a biomarker for good response to PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in endometrial cancer.},

   abstract = {Patients with endometrial cancer differ in terms of the extent of T-cell infiltration; however, the association between T-cell subpopulations and patient outcomes remains unexplored. We characterized 285 early-stage endometrial carcinoma samples for T-cell infiltrates in a tissue microarray format using multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry. The proportion of T cells and their subpopulations were associated with clinicopathological features and relapse-free survival outcomes. CD3+ CD4+ infiltrates were more abundant in the patients with higher grade or non-endometrioid histology. Cytotoxic T cells (CD25+, PD-1+, and PD-L1+) were strongly associated with longer relapse-free survival. Moreover, CD3+ PD-1+ stromal cells were independent of other immune T-cell populations and clinicopathological factors in predicting relapses. Patients with high stromal T-cell fraction of CD3+ PD-1+ cells were associated with a 5-year relapse-free survival rate of 93.7% compared to 79.0% in patients with low CD3+ PD-1+ fraction. Moreover, in patients classically linked to a favorable outcome (such as endometrioid subtype and low-grade tumors), the stromal CD3+ PD-1+ T-cell fraction remained prognostically significant. This study supports that T-cell infiltrates play a significant prognostic role in early-stage endometrial carcinoma. Specifically, CD3+ PD-1+ stromal cells emerge as a promising novel prognostic biomarker.},

   abstract = {Objective: POLE-mutant, microsatellite-instable (MSI), p53-mutant and non-specific molecular profile (NSMP) are TCGA-defined molecular subgroups of endometrial cancer (EC). Hypothesizing that morphology and tumor immunology might differ depending on molecular background concerning composition and prognostic impact, we aimed to comprehensively interconnect morphologic, immunologic and molecular data. Methods: TCGA-defined molecular groups were determined by immunohistochemistry and sequencing in n = 142 endometrioid EC. WHO-defined histopathological grading was performed. The immunologic microenvironment (iTME) was characterised by the quantification of intraepithelial and stromal populations of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL: overall T-cells; T-Killer cells; regulatory T-cells (Treg)). Immunologic parameters were correlated with WHO-grading, TCGA-subgroups and prognosis. Results: High density TIL were significantly more frequent in high-grade (G3) compared to low-grade (G1/2) EC in the whole cohort and in the subgroup of POLE-wildtype-/microsatellite-stable-EC. MSI was associated with high-level TIL-infiltration when taking into account the type of mismatch repair defect (MLH1/PMS2; MSH2/MSH6). Prognostic impact of biomarkers depended on molecular subgroups: In p53-mutant EC, Treg were independently prognostic, in NSMP, the unique independently prognostic biomarker was WHO-grading. Conclusions: EC morphology and immunology differ depending on genetics. Our study delineated two molecularly distinct subgroups of immunogenic EC characterized by high-density TIL-infiltration: MSI EC and high-grade POLE-wildtype/microsatellite-stable-EC. Prognostic impact of TIL-populations relied on TCGA-subgroups indicating specific roles for TIL depending on molecular background. In NSMP, histopathological grading was the only prognostic biomarker demonstrating the relevance of WHO-grading in an era of molecular subtyping.},

   abstract = {Background: PTEN inactivation is the most frequent genetic aberration in endometrial cancer. One of the phosphatase-independent roles of PTEN is associated with homologous recombination (HR) in nucleus. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) plays key roles in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks, and a PARP inhibitor induces synthetic lethality in cancer cells with HR deficiency. We examined the anti-tumor activity of olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, and its correlation between the sensitivity and status of PTEN in endometrial cancer cell lines.Methods: The response to olaparib was evaluated using a clonogenic assay with SF50 values (concentration to inhibit cell survival to 50%) in 16 endometrial cancer cell lines. The effects of PTEN on the sensitivity to olaparib and ionizing radiation (IR) exposure were compared between parental HEC-6 (PTEN-null) and HEC-6 PTEN + (stably expressing wild-type PTEN) cells by clonogenic assay, foci formation of RAD51 and γH2AX, and induction of cleaved PARP. The effects of siRNA to PTEN were analyzed in cells with wild-type PTEN.Results: The SF50 values were 100 nM or less in four (25%: sensitive) cell lines; whereas, SF50 values were 1,000 nM or more in four (25%: resistant) cell lines. PTEN mutations were not associated with sensitivity to olaparib (Mutant [n = 12]: 746 ± 838 nM; Wild-type [n = 4]: 215 ± 85 nM, p = 0.26 by Student's t test). RAD51 expression was observed broadly and was not associated with PTEN status in the 16 cell lines. The number of colonies in the clonogenic assay, the foci formation of RAD51 and γH2AX, and the induction of apoptosis were not affected by PTEN introduction in the HEC-6 PTEN + cells. The expression level of nuclear PTEN was not elevated within 24 h following IR in the HEC-6-PTEN + cells. In addition, knocking down PTEN by siRNA did not alter the sensitivity to olaparib in 2 cell lines with wild-type PTEN.Conclusions: Our results suggest that olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, is effective on certain endometrial cancer cell lines. Inactivation of PTEN might not affect the DNA repair function. Predictive biomarkers are warranted to utilize olaparib in endometrial cancer. © 2014 Miyasaka et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: Advanced recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) is the leading cause of gynecologic cancer-related death in developed countries and new treatments are needed. Previous studies of immune checkpoint blockade showed low objective response rates (ORR) in ROC with no identified predictive biomarker. Patients and methods: This phase II study of pembrolizumab (NCT02674061) examined two patient cohorts with ROC: cohort A received one to three prior lines of treatment with a platinum-free interval (PFI) or treatment-free interval (TFI) between 3 and 12 months and cohort B received four to six prior lines with a PFI/TFI of ≥3 months. Pembrolizumab 200 mg was administered intravenously every 3 weeks until cancer progression, toxicity, or completion of 2 years. Primary end points were ORR by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 per blinded independent central review by cohort and by PD-L1 expression measured as combined positive score (CPS). Secondary end points included duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results: Cohort A enrolled 285 patients; the first 100 served as the training set for PD-L1 biomarker analysis. Cohort B enrolled 91 patients. ORR was 7.4% for cohort A and 9.9% for cohort B. Median DOR was 8.2 months for cohort A and not reached for cohort B. DCR was 37.2% and 37.4%, respectively, in cohorts A and B. Based on the training set analysis, CPS 1 and 10 were selected for evaluation in the confirmation set. In the confirmation set, ORR was 4.1% for CPS <1, 5.7% CPS ≥1, and 10.0% for CPS ≥10. PFS was 2.1 months for both cohorts. Median OS was not reached for cohort A and was 17.6 months for cohort B. Toxicities were consistent with other single-agent pembrolizumab trials. Conclusions: Single-agent pembrolizumab showed modest activity in patients with ROC. Higher PD-L1 expression was correlated with higher response.},

   abstract = {Endometrial cancer is rising in prevalence. The standard treatment modality of hysterectomy is becoming increasingly inadequate due primarily to the direct link between endometrial cancer and high BMI which increases surgical risks. This is an immunogenic cancer, with unique molecular subtypes associated with differential immune infiltration. Despite the immunogenicity of endometrial cancer, there is limited pre-clinical and clinical evidence of the function of immune cells in both the normal and cancerous endometrium. Immune checkpoint inhibitors for endometrial cancer are the most well studied type of immune therapy but these are not currently used as standard-of-care and importantly, they represent only one method of immune manipulation. There is limited evidence regarding the use of other immunotherapies as surgical adjuvants or alternatives. Levonorgestrel-loaded intra-uterine systems can also be effective for early-stage disease, but with varying success. There is currently no known reason as to what predisposes some patients to respond while others do not. As hormones can directly influence immune cell function, it is worth investigating the immune compartment in this context. This review assesses the immunological components of the endometrium and describes how the immune microenvironment changes with hormones, obesity, and in progression to malignancy. It also describes the importance of investigating novel pathways for immunotherapy.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Copy number-high endometrial carcinomas were described by The Cancer Genome Atlas as high-grade endometrioid and serous cancers showing frequent copy-number alterations (CNA), low mutational burden (i.e., non-hypermutant), nearuniversal TP53 mutation, and unfavorable clinical outcomes. We sought to investigate and compare the clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of non-hypermutant TP53-altered endometrial carcinomas of four histologic types. Experimental Design: TP53-mutated endometrial carcinomas, defined as TP53-mutant tumors lacking microsatellite instability or pathogenic POLE mutations, were identified (n = 238) in a cohort of 1,239 endometrial carcinomas subjected to clinical massively parallel sequencing of 410-468 cancer-related genes. Somatic mutations and CNAs (n = 238), and clinicopathologic features were determined (n = 185, initial treatment planning at our institution). Results: TP53-mutated endometrial carcinomas encompassed uterine serous (n=102, 55.1%), high-grade endometrial carcinoma with ambiguous features/not otherwise specified (EC-NOS; n = 44, 23.8%), endometrioid carcinomas of all tumor grades (n = 28, 15.1%), and clear cell carcinomas (n = 11, 5.9%). PTEN mutations were significantly more frequent in endometrioid carcinomas, SPOP mutations in clear cell carcinomas, and CCNE1 amplification in serous carcinomas/EC-NOS; however, none of these genomic alterations were exclusive to any given histologic type. ERBB2 amplification was present at similar frequencies across TP53- mutated histologic types (7.7%-18.6%). Although overall survival was similar across histologic types, serous carcinomas presented more frequently at stage IV, had more persistent and/or recurrent disease, and reduced disease-free survival. Conclusions: TP53-mutated endometrial carcinomas display clinical and molecular similarities across histologic subtypes. Our data provide evidence to suggest performance of ERBB2 assessment in all TP53-mutated endometrial carcinomas. Given the distinct clinical features of serous carcinomas, histologic classification continues to be relevant.},

   abstract = {Background The endometrial cancer molecular classification has been integrated into the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic classification and European treatment guidelines, and provides direction towards more effective and less toxic adjuvant treatment strategies for women with endometrial cancer. Primary Objective(s) The RAINBO program of clinical trials will investigate four molecular class-directed adjuvant treatment strategies following surgical resection to either increase cure rates through the addition of novel targeted therapies or safely reduce toxicity and improve quality of life through treatment de-escalation. Study Hypothesis Molecular-directed adjuvant treatment strategies will improve clinical outcomes and reduce toxicity of unwarranted therapies in women with endometrial cancer. The overarching and translational research RAINBO program will advance knowledge of predictive and prognostic (bio)markers that will improve prognostication and treatment allocation. Trial Design The RAINBO program is a platform of four international clinical trials and an overarching research program. The randomized phase III p53abn-RED trial for women with invasive stage I-III p53abn endometrial cancer compares adjuvant chemoradiation followed by olaparib for 2 years with adjuvant chemoradiation alone. The randomized phase III MMRd-GREEN trial for women with stage II (with lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI)) or stage III mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) endometrial cancer compares adjuvant radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant durvalumab for 1 year to radiotherapy alone. The randomized phase III NSMP-ORANGE trial is a treatment de-escalation trial for women with estrogen receptor positive stage II (with LVSI) or stage III no specific molecular profile (NSMP) endometrial cancer comparing radiotherapy followed by progestin for 2 years to adjuvant chemoradiation. The POLEmut-BLUE trial is a phase II trial in which the safety of de-escalation of adjuvant therapy is investigated for women with stage I-III POLEmut endometrial cancer: no adjuvant therapy for lower-risk disease and no adjuvant therapy or radiotherapy alone for higher-risk disease. The overarching RAINBO program will combine data and tumor material of all participants to perform translational research and evaluate molecular class-based adjuvant therapy in terms of efficacy, toxicity, quality of life, and cost-utility. Major Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria include a histologically confirmed diagnosis of endometrial cancer treated by hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without lymphadenectomy or sentinel lymph node biopsy, with no macroscopic residual disease after surgery and no distant metastases, and molecular classification according to the WHO 2020 algorithm. Primary Endpoint(s) Recurrence-free survival at 3 years in the p53abn-RED, MMRd-GREEN, and NSMP-ORANGE trials and pelvic recurrence at 3 years in the POLEmut-BLUE trial. Sample Size The p53abn-RED trial will include 554 patients, the MMRd-GREEN trial 316, the NSMP-ORANGE trial 600, and the POLEmut-BLUE trial 145 (120 for lower-risk disease and approximately 25 for higher-risk disease). The overarching research program will pool the four sub-trials resulting in a total sample size of around 1600. Estimated Dates for Completing Accrual and Presenting Results The four clinical trials will have different completion dates; main results are expected from 2028. Trial Registration Number The RAINBO program is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05255653).},

So far, emerging clinical data show limited clinical efficacy of these agents in ovarian cancer with objective response rates of 10–15% with some durable responses. In this review, we present emerging clinical data of completed trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors and review ongoing studies. In addition we examine the current knowledge of the tumor microenvironment of ovarian cancers with a focus on the significance of PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes on predicting response to immune checkpoint blockade. We evaluate approaches to improve treatment outcomes through the use of predictive biomarkers and patient selection. Finally, we review management considerations including immune related adverse events and response criteria.},

   abstract = {Background In this study, we assessed the activity of durvalumab, an antibody to programmed death ligand-1, in two cohorts of women with advanced endometrial cancers (AEC) - mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) and mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). Methods A multicenter phase two study was performed in women with AEC with pMMR tumor progressing after one to three lines of chemotherapy and women with AEC with dMMR tumor progressing after zero to three lines of chemotherapy. Mismatch repair status was based on immunohistochemistry expression. All women received durvalumab 1500 mg given every 4 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective tumor response by RECIST V.1.1 modified for immune-based therapeutics. Results Seventy-one women were recruited: 35 dMMR and 36 pMMR. Median follow-up was 19 vs 21 months in dMMR versus pMMR, respectively. Median age was 67 years. Histology in dMMR versus pMMR included endometrioid (94% vs 57%) and serous (0% vs 31%) and was high grade in 26% vs 74%. The objective tumor response rate (OTRR) in the dMMR cohort was 47% (17/36, 95% CI 32 to 63), including 6 complete responses and 11 partial responses (PRs)) vs 3% in the pMMR cohort (1/35, 95% CI 1 to 15, PR). In the dMMR cohort, durvalumab was the first-line therapy in 58% (OTRR 57%) and the second-line therapy in 39% (OTRR 38%). Median progression-free survival was 8.3 months in the dMMR cohort vs 1.8 months in the pMMR cohort. The 12-month overall survival (OS) rate was 71% in dMMR vs 51% in pMMR, with median OS not reached for dMMR vs 12 months for pMMR. Immune-related adverse events occurred in 14 women, mostly grades 1-2. Conclusion Durvalumab monotherapy showed promising activity and acceptable safety in AEC with dMMR regardless of prior lines of chemotherapy, but activity was limited in AEC with pMMR.

   abstract = {<h2>ABSTRACT</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Treatment with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with agents such as anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and/or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) can result in impressive response rates and durable disease remission but only in a subset of patients with cancer. Expression of PD-L1 has demonstrated utility in selecting patients for response to ICB and has proven to be an important biomarker for patient selection. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is emerging as a potential biomarker. However, refinement of interpretation and contextualization is required.</p><h3>Materials and methods</h3><p>In this review, we outline the evolution of TMB as a biomarker in oncology, delineate how TMB can be applied in the clinic, discuss current limitations as a diagnostic test, and highlight mechanistic insights unveiled by the study of TMB. We review available data to date studying TMB as a biomarker for response to ICB by tumor type, focusing on studies proposing a threshold for TMB as a predictive biomarker for ICB activity.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>High TMB consistently selects for benefit with ICB therapy. In lung, bladder and head and neck cancers, the current predictive TMB thresholds proposed approximate 200 non-synonymous somatic mutations by whole exome sequencing (WES). PD-L1 expression influences response to ICB in high TMB tumors with single agent PD-(L)1 antibodies; however, response may not be dependent on PD-L1 expression in the setting of anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 combination therapy. Disease-specific TMB thresholds for effective prediction of response in various other malignancies are not well established.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>TMB, in concert with PD-L1 expression, has been demonstrated to be a useful biomarker for ICB selection across some cancer types; however, further prospective validation studies are required. TMB determination by selected targeted panels has been correlated with WES. Calibration and harmonization will be required for optimal utility and alignment across all platforms currently used internationally. Key challenges will need to be addressed before broader use in different tumor types.</p>},

   abstract = {Objectives: Optimal management of patients with stage IA p53abn endometrial cancer without myoinvasion, classified as intermediate risk in the 2020 European Society of Gynaecological Oncology, European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology, and European Society of Pathology (ESGO-ESTRO-ESP) guidelines, and the 2022 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, is currently unclear. Practice varies from surgery alone to adjuvant radiation±chemotherapy. Our aim was to assess the risk of disease recurrence in patients with stage IA p53abn endometrial cancer without myoinvasion compared with stage IA with myoinvasion (<50%). Methods: Stage IA p53abn endometrial cancers were identified from retrospective cohorts. Cases were segregated into stage IA with no myoinvasion, including (1) tumor restricted to a polyp, (2) residual endometrial tumor, and (3) no residual tumor in hysterectomy specimen, versus stage IA p53abn with myoinvasion (<50%), with treatment and outcomes assessed. Results: There were 65 stage IA p53abn endometrial cancers with no myoinvasion (22 polyp confined, 38 residual endometrial tumor, 2 no residual in hysterectomy specimen, 3 not specified) and 97 with myoinvasion. There was no difference in survival outcomes in patients with stage IA without myoinvasion (16% of patients recurred, 19% if there was residual endometrial disease) compared with stage IA with myoinvasion (17%). The risk of recurrence was lowest in patients with stage IA p53abn endometrial cancer without myoinvasion treated with chemotherapy±radiation (8%). Most recurrences in patients with stage IA without myoinvasion were distant (89%), with no isolated vaginal vault recurrences, and all except one distant recurrence occurred in patients who had not received adjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusion: The recurrence rate in patients with stage IA p53abn endometrial cancer without myoinvasion was 16%, highest in the setting of residual endometrial disease (19%), and exceeding the threshold where adjuvant therapy is often considered. The high frequency of distant recurrences observed may support chemotherapy as part of the treatment regimen.},

   abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population‐based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries (through 2020) and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (through 2021). In 2024, 2,001,140 new cancer cases and 611,720 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer mortality continued to decline through 2021, averting over 4 million deaths since 1991 because of reductions in smoking, earlier detection for some cancers, and improved treatment options in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. However, these gains are threatened by increasing incidence for 6 of the top 10 cancers. Incidence rates increased during 2015–2019 by 0.6%–1% annually for breast, pancreas, and uterine corpus cancers and by 2%–3% annually for prostate, liver (female), kidney, and human papillomavirus‐associated oral cancers and for melanoma. Incidence rates also increased by 1%–2% annually for cervical (ages 30–44 years) and colorectal cancers (ages <55 years) in young adults. Colorectal cancer was the fourth‐leading cause of cancer death in both men and women younger than 50 years in the late‐1990s but is now first in men and second in women. Progress is also hampered by wide persistent cancer disparities; compared to White people, mortality rates are two‐fold higher for prostate, stomach and uterine corpus cancers in Black people and for liver, stomach, and kidney cancers in Native American people. Continued national progress will require increased investment in cancer prevention and access to equitable treatment, especially among American Indian and Alaska Native and Black individuals.},

Patients and Methods: All patients with endometrial carcinoma, treated at our hospital, were classified into four categories-Category I: Type I positive for TILs; category II: type I negative for TILs; category III: type II positive for TILs; and category IV: type II negative for TILs. Prognoses were compared across all the categories. Positivity for TILs was defined as a continuously formed thick zone of TILs at the invasive front. Results: Multivariate analyses of progression-free and overall survival indicated that category classification was an independent prognostic factor, with hazard ratios of 3.127, 3.483, and 8.459 for progression-free survival, and 3.444, 4.374, and 11.058 for OS for patients in categories II, III, and IV, respectively. Conclusion: Combining traditional histological classification with TIL status might better predict prognosis of endometrial carcinoma.},

   abstract = {Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have emerged as a prognostic marker in endometrial cancer (EC). However, the role of TILs in EC with distinct histology grades and molecular types (such as mismatch repair [MMR] deficiency) has not yet been made clear. We retrospectively included 237 patients with primary EC who underwent a standard staging operation of laparoscopic or laparotomy total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for analyses. An independent pathologist who was blind to the study patients’ information reviewed the pathologic slides to assess TILs according to the method introduced by the International Immuno-Oncology Biomarkers Working Group in 2017. The outcomes of interest included both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The Kaplan–Meier method was used to determine the curves of PFS and OS according to TILs, and also in the relevant subgroups (low-grade vs. high-grade, MMR-proficient vs. MMR-deficient). After a median follow-up duration of 1.82 years, 18 patients had experienced either disease progression or death. Overall, TILs (+) were not associated with PFS or OS. We did observe, however, that TILs (+) were associated with a better PFS (p = 0.045) in patients with high-grade EC, but not in those with low-grade tumors (p = 0.733). The effect of TILs on PFS was not observed in patients with MMR-proficient (p = 0.347) or MMR-deficient (p = 0.168) EC. TILs were associated with a better PFS in patients with high-grade EC. Our results suggest that TILs may be a potential prognostic marker in these patients.},

   abstract = {Objective The lack of randomized clinical data pertaining to optimal surgery and adjuvant treatment in women with high-risk histotypes of endometrial cancer has resulted in selective management based on institutional policies. The objective of this study was to assess differences in treatment strategies and their outcomes among various institutions. Method High-risk endometrial cancer cases (2000 - 2012) with corresponding clinicopathologic data were collected from 7 academic cancer centers. Histotypes included grade 3 endometrioid (EC3), serous (ESC), clear cell (CCC) and carcinosarcoma (CS). Associations with overall survival were performed using Cox proportional hazard regression. Results 1260 patients treated between 2000 and 2012 were included in the study: 398 EC3, 449 ESC, 91 CCC, 236 CS and 83 'other'. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiation, and extent of surgical staging were statistically different among the 7 centers (P < 0.001). Histotype was independently associated with overall survival (OS) in patients with stage 1 and 2 disease who underwent surgical staging (P = 0.0324). Adjuvant radiation was associated with improved OS for EC3 and CCC and adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved OS for ESC and CS. There was a high rate of recurrence (17.8% and 21.4%) in completely staged, stage 1A patients with ESC and CS respectively. Conclusion There exists a wide variation in practice and outcomes for high-risk histotypes of endometrial cancer. The relative impact of adjuvant therapy appears to be histotype dependent and prospective studies examining adjuvant treatment in high-risk histotypes should use caution combining them together.},

   abstract = {Standard molecular classification of endometrial cancers (EC) is now endorsed by the WHO and identifies p53-abnormal (p53abn) EC as the subgroup with the poorest prognosis and the most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemo(radio)therapy. P53abn EC are POLE wildtype, mismatch repair proficient and show abnormal immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for p53. Correct interpretation of routinely performed p53 IHC has therefore become of paramount importance. We aimed to comprehensively investigate abnormal p53 IHC patterns and their relation to clinicopathological and molecular features. Tumor material of 411 molecularly classified high-risk EC from consenting patients from the PORTEC-3 clinical trial were collected. p53 IHC was successful in 408 EC and was considered abnormal when the tumor showed a mutant expression pattern (including subclonal): overexpression, null or cytoplasmic. The presence of pathogenic mutations was determined by next generation sequencing (NGS). Abnormal p53 expression was observed in 131/408 (32%) tumors. The most common abnormal p53 IHC pattern was overexpression (n = 89, 68%), followed by null (n = 12, 9%) and cytoplasmic (n = 3, 2%). Subclonal abnormal p53 staining was observed in 27 cases (21%), which was frequently but not exclusively, associated with POLE mutations and/or MMRd (n = 22/27; p &lt; 0.001). Agreement between p53 IHC and TP53 NGS was observed in 90.7%, resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of 83.6% and 94.3%, respectively. Excluding POLEmut and MMRd EC, as per the WHO-endorsed algorithm, increased the accuracy to 94.5% with sensitivity and specificity of 95.0% and 94.1%, respectively. Our data shows that awareness of the abnormal p53 IHC patterns are prerequisites for correct EC molecular classification. Subclonal abnormal p53 expression is a strong indicator for POLEmut and/or MMRd EC. No significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed among the abnormal p53 IHC patterns. Our data support use of the WHO-endorsed algorithm and combining the different abnormal p53 IHC patterns into one diagnostic entity (p53abn EC).},

   abstract = {Endometrial carcinosarcoma is a rare and aggressive high-grade endometrial carcinoma with secondary sarcomatous trans-differentiation (conversion theory). The clinical presentation and diagnostic work-up roughly align with those of the more common endometrioid counterpart, although endometrial carcinosarcoma is more frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage. Endometrial carcinosarcoma is not a single entity but encompasses different histological subtypes, depending on the type of carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements. The majority of endometrial carcinosarcomas are characterized by p53 abnormalities. The proportion of POLE and microsatellite instablity-high (MSI-H) is directly related to the epithelial component, being approximately 25% and 3% in endometrioid and non-endometrioid components.

The management of non-metastatic disease is based on a multimodal approach with optimal surgery followed by (concomitant or sequential) chemotherapy and radiotherapy, even for early stages. Palliative chemotherapy is recommended in the metastatic or recurrent setting, with carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet being the first-line regimen. Although the introduction of immunotherapy plus/minus a tyrosine kinase inhibitor shifted the paradigm of treatment of patients with recurrent endometrial cancer, patients with endometrial carcinosarcoma were excluded from most studies evaluating single-agent immunotherapy or the combination. However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in endometrial cancer (all histotypes) after progression on chemotherapy and single-agent immunotherapy in MSI-H cancers. In the era of precision medicine, emerging knowledge on molecular endometrial carcinosarcoma is opening new promising therapeutic options for more personalized treatment. The present review outlines state-of-the-art knowledge and future directions for patients with endometrial carcinosarcoma.

   abstract = {Objective: It is clear that uterine carcinosarcomas and uterine papillary serous carcinomas (UPSC) have an adverse impact on outcome, but whether carcinosarcomas are worse than UPSC is unclear. The purpose of this study is to compare the pathology, survival, and disease recurrence of patients with carcinosarcomas to patients with UPSC. Methods: The medical records of patients diagnosed with carcinosarcomas and UPSC between 1996 and 2009 at Samsung Medical Center were retrospectively analyzed. Information from pathology reports, site of relapse, time to recurrence, and death was obtained. The survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Thirty seven patients with carcinosarcomas and 38 patients with UPSC were identified during the study period. There was no significant difference in clinical characteristics including age, body mass index, proportion with advanced stage disease, rate of optimal debulking, and adjuvant treatment used. In addition, the pathology showed no significant difference in tumor size, myometrial involvement, lymphovascular invasion, peritoneal cytology, cervical invasion, and lymph node involvement. Patients with carcinosarcomas had similar patterns of relapse as the patients with UPSC. There was no difference in the progression-free and overall survival between the carcinosarcomas and UPSC patients (p=0.804 and p=0.651, respectively). Conclusion: Patients with carcinosarcomas had similar clinicopathological features compared to the patients with UPSC. © 2011.

   abstract = {Objective This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics of carcinosarcoma, grade 3 endometrial endometrioid carcinoma (G3EEC), uterine serous carcinoma (USC), and uterine clear cell adenocarcinoma (CC) to determine whether carcinosarcoma exhibited the same characteristics and outcomes as the other 3 high-risk endometrial cancers. Methods A total of 358 patients recruited from the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University were included in this study; the cases included 44 carcinosarcomas, 118 G3EECs, 118 USCs, and 78 CCs. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze outcomes and prognostic factors. Results Uterine carcinosarcomas had significantly worse outcomes (overall survival, disease-specific survival, and recurrence-free survival) compared with G3EEC, USC, and CC (P < 0.001), whereas the other 3 shared similar outcomes. Carcinosarcoma type was an independent factor, even stratified by stage. Eighty-three percent of recurred carcinosarcoma patients occurred within 1 year. Compared with USC and CC, patients with carcinosarcoma had a greater incidence of deep myometrial invasion (55.8%, P < 0.05) and cervical stromal involvement (P = 0.046). The carcinomatous regions of carcinosarcomas demonstrated a similar ER/P53 expression pattern as did USC and CC. However, all features were similar in carcinosarcoma and G3EEC patients, although the P53-positive rate was higher in carcinosarcoma patients compared with G3EEC patients (59.0% vs 38.5%, P = 0.037). For carcinosarcomas, a multivariate analysis showed that advanced stage (P = 0.006) was an independent prognostic factor for disease-specific survival. With regard to endometrioid-or-not epithelial and heterologous-or-homologous sarcomatous components, none of these components demonstrated apparent relationship with prognosis. Conclusions Carcinosarcomas exhibited significantly poorer outcomes than did G3EECs, USCs, and CCs. Therefore, it seems reasonable to regard carcinosarcomas as a particular type among high-risk epithelial endometrial carcinomas.},

   abstract = {Background: It is unclear whether uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) is more aggressive than endometrial serous carcinoma (SC) and clear cell carcinoma (CCC). Objectives: To compare the prognosis of UCS to that of endometrial SC and CCC, through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Four electronic databases were searched from January 2000 to October 2020. All studies assessing hazard ratio (HR) for death in UCS vs SC and/or CCC. HRs for death with 95% confidence interval were extracted and pooled by using a random-effect model. A significant P-value <0.05 was adopted. Results: Six studies with 11 029 patients (4995 with UCS, 4634 with SC, 1346 with CCC and 54 with either SC or CCC) were included. UCS showed a significantly worse prognosis than SC/CCC both overall (HR = 1.51; P = 0.008) and at early stage (HR = 1.58; P < 0.001). Similar results were found for UCS vs SC (HR = 1.53; P < 0.001) and UCS vs CCC (HR = 1.60; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Compared to SC and CCC, UCS has a significantly worse prognosis, with a 1.5–1.6-fold increased risk of death. This might justify a more aggressive treatment for UCS compared to SC and CCC. Further studies are necessary to define the prognostic impact of different molecular subgroups.},

   abstract = {The incidence and mortality rates from endometrial cancer continue to increase worldwide, while rates in most other cancers have either plateaued or declined considerably. Uterine serous carcinoma represents a fraction of all endometrial malignancies each year, yet this histology is responsible for nearly 40% of all endometrial cancer-related deaths. These deaths disproportionately affect black women, who have higher rates of advanced disease at diagnosis. Molecular genetic analyses reveal major alterations including TP53 mutation, PIK3CA mutation/amplification, ERBB2 amplification, CCNE1 amplification, FBXW7 mutation/deletion, PPP2R1A mutation, and somatic mutations involving homologous recombination genes. Clinical risk factors for uterine serous carcinoma include advancing age, a history of breast cancer, tamoxifen usage, and the hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome. Surgery remains the cornerstone of treatment. Recent advances in our understanding of uterine serous carcinoma molecular drivers have led to development of targeted therapeutics that promise improved outcomes for patients. Overexpression or amplification of HER2 in uterine serous carcinoma carries a poor prognosis; yet this actionable target has led to the incorporation of several anti-HER2 therapies, including trastuzumab which, when added to conventional chemotherapy, is associated with improved survival for women with advanced and recurrent HER2-positive disease. The combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib is also a promising targeted treatment strategy for women with uterine serous carcinoma, with a recent phase II study suggesting a 50% response rate in women with recurrent disease. Several trials examining additional targeted agents are ongoing. Despite years of stalled progress, meaningful, tailored treatment options are emerging for patients with this uncommon and biologically aggressive endometrial cancer subtype.},

   abstract = {Serous endometrial cancer represents a relative rare entity accounting for about 10% of all diagnosed endometrial cancer, but it is responsible for 40% of endometrial cancer-related deaths. Patients with serous endometrial cancer are often diagnosed at earlier disease stage, but remain at higher risk of recurrence and poorer prognosis when compared stage-for-stage with endometrioid subtype endometrial cancer. Serous endometrial cancers are characterized by marked nuclear atypia and abnormal p53 staining in immunohistochemistry. The mainstay of treatment for newly diagnosed serous endometrial cancer includes a multi-modal therapy with surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Unfortunately, despite these efforts, survival outcomes still remain poor. Recently, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network classified all endometrial cancer types into four categories, of which, serous endometrial cancer mostly is found within the “copy number high” group. This group is characterized by the increased cell cycle deregulation (e.g., CCNE1, MYC, PPP2R1A, PIKCA, ERBB2 and CDKN2A) and TP53 mutations (90%). To date, the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib is an effective treatment modality in second-line therapy, with a response rate of 50% in advanced/recurrent serous endometrial cancer. Owing to the unfavorable outcomes of serous endometrial cancer, clinical trials are a priority. At present, ongoing studies are testing novel combinations of various targeted and immunotherapeutic agents in newly diagnosed and advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer - an important strategy for serous endometrial cancer, whereby tumors are usually p53+ and pMMR, making response to PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy unlikely. Here, the rare tumor working group (including members from the European Society of Gynecologic Oncology (ESGO), Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG), and Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (JGOG)), performed a narrative review reporting on the current landscape of serous endometrial cancer and focusing on standard and emerging therapeutic options for patients affected by this difficult disease.},

   abstract = {Objective: Mutational signatures provide insights into the biological processes shaping tumor genomes and may inform patient therapy. We sought to define the mutational signatures of i) endometrioid and serous endometrial carcinomas (ECs), stratified into the four molecular subtypes, ii) uterine carcinosarcomas, and iii) matched primary and metastatic ECs. Methods: Whole-exome sequencing MC3 data from primary endometrioid and serous carcinomas (n = 232) and uterine carcinosarcomas (n = 57) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and matched primary and metastatic ECs (n = 61, 26 patients) were reanalyzed, subjected to mutational signature analysis using deconstructSigs, and correlated with clinicopathologic and genomic data. Results: POLE (ultramutated) and MSI (hypermutated) molecular subtypes displayed dominant mutational signatures associated with POLE mutations (15/17 cases) and microsatellite instability (55/65 cases), respectively. Most endometrioid and serous carcinomas of copy-number low (endometrioid) and copy-number high (serous-like) molecular subtypes, and carcinosarcomas displayed a dominant aging-associated signature 1. Only 15% (9/60) of copy-number high (serous-like) ECs had a dominant signature 3 (homologous recombination DNA repair deficiency (HRD)-related), a prevalence significantly lower than that found in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (54%, p < 0.001) or basal-like breast cancers (46%, p < 0.001). Shifts from aging- or POLE- to MSI-related mutational processes were observed in the progression from primary to metastatic ECs in a subset of cases. Conclusions: The mutational processes underpinning ECs vary even among tumors of the same TCGA molecular subtype and in the progression from primary to metastatic ECs. Only a minority of copy-number high (serous-like) ECs display genomics features of HRD and would likely benefit from HRD-directed therapies.},

Thus, SEC patients may benefit from targeted treatments used in HGSOC, e.g., PARP inhibitors. However, the preclinical and clinical knowledge about SEC is scarce, and the exact role of defective DNA repair in this tumor subgroup is largely unknown. We aimed to outline the prevalence of homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD), copy-number alterations, and somatic mutations in SEC. OncoScan SNP arrays were applied to 19 tumors in a consecutive SEC series to calculate HRD scores and explore global copy-number profiles and genomic aberrations. Copy-number signatures were established and targeted sequencing of 27 HRD-associated genes was performed. All factors were examined in relation to HRD scores to investigate potential drivers of the HRD phenotype. Ten of the 19 SEC tumors (53%) had an HRD score > 42, considered to reflect an HRD phenotype. Higher HRD score was associated with loss of heterozygosity in key HRD genes, and copy-number signatures associated with non-BRCA1/2 dependent HRD in HGSOC. A high number of SECs display an HRD phenotype. It remains to be elucidated whether this also confers PARP inhibitor sensitivity.},

   abstract = {The standard of treatment for node-positive endometrial cancer (FIGO Stage IIIC) in North America has been systemic therapy with or without additional external beam radiation therapy (RT) given as pelvic or extended field RT. However, this treatment paradigm is rapidly evolving with improvements in systemic chemotherapy, the emergence of targeted therapies, and improved molecular characterization of these tumors. The biggest question facing providers regarding management of stage IIIC endometrial cancer at this time is: what is the best management strategy to use with regard to combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, other targeted therapeutics, and radiation that will maximize clinical benefit and minimize toxicities for the best patient outcomes? While clinicians await the results of ongoing clinical trials regarding combined immunotherapy/RT as well as management based on molecular classification, we must make decisions regarding the best treatment combinations for our patients. Based on the available literature, we are offering stage IIIC patients without measurable disease postoperatively both adjuvant chemotherapy and IMRT with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and with or without pembrolizumab/dostarlimab as primary adjuvant therapy. Patients with measurable disease post operatively, high risk histologies, or stage IV disease receive chemoimmunotherapy, and vaginal brachytherapy is added for those with uterine risk factors for vaginal recurrence. In the setting of endometrioid EC recurrence more than 6 months after treatment, patients with pelvic nodal and vaginal recurrence are offered IMRT and brachytherapy without chemotherapy. For measurable recurrence not suitable for pelvic radiation alone, chemoimmunotherapy is preferred as standard of care.},

   abstract = {Background The endometrial cancer molecular classification has been integrated into the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic classification and European treatment guidelines, and provides direction towards more effective and less toxic adjuvant treatment strategies for women with endometrial cancer.

Primary Objective(s) The RAINBO program of clinical trials will investigate four molecular class-directed adjuvant treatment strategies following surgical resection to either increase cure rates through the addition of novel targeted therapies or safely reduce toxicity and improve quality of life through treatment de-escalation.

Study Hypothesis Molecular-directed adjuvant treatment strategies will improve clinical outcomes and reduce toxicity of unwarranted therapies in women with endometrial cancer. The overarching and translational research RAINBO program will advance knowledge of predictive and prognostic (bio)markers that will improve prognostication and treatment allocation.

Trial Design The RAINBO program is a platform of four international clinical trials and an overarching research program. The randomized phase III p53abn-RED trial for women with invasive stage I–III p53abn endometrial cancer compares adjuvant chemoradiation followed by olaparib for 2 years with adjuvant chemoradiation alone. The randomized phase III MMRd-GREEN trial for women with stage II (with lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI)) or stage III mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) endometrial cancer compares adjuvant radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant durvalumab for 1 year to radiotherapy alone. The randomized phase III NSMP-ORANGE trial is a treatment de-escalation trial for women with estrogen receptor positive stage II (with LVSI) or stage III no specific molecular profile (NSMP) endometrial cancer comparing radiotherapy followed by progestin for 2 years to adjuvant chemoradiation. The POLE mut-BLUE trial is a phase II trial in which the safety of de-escalation of adjuvant therapy is investigated for women with stage I–III POLE mut endometrial cancer: no adjuvant therapy for lower-risk disease and no adjuvant therapy or radiotherapy alone for higher-risk disease. The overarching RAINBO program will combine data and tumor material of all participants to perform translational research and evaluate molecular class-based adjuvant therapy in terms of efficacy, toxicity, quality of life, and cost-utility.

Major Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria include a histologically confirmed diagnosis of endometrial cancer treated by hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without lymphadenectomy or sentinel lymph node biopsy, with no macroscopic residual disease after surgery and no distant metastases, and molecular classification according to the WHO 2020 algorithm.

Primary Endpoint(s) Recurrence-free survival at 3 years in the p53abn-RED, MMRd-GREEN, and NSMP-ORANGE trials and pelvic recurrence at 3 years in the POLE mut-BLUE trial.

Sample Size The p53abn-RED trial will include 554 patients, the MMRd-GREEN trial 316, the NSMP-ORANGE trial 600, and the POLE mut-BLUE trial 145 (120 for lower-risk disease and approximately 25 for higher-risk disease). The overarching research program will pool the four sub-trials resulting in a total sample size of around 1600.

Estimated Dates for Completing Accrual and Presenting Results The four clinical trials will have different completion dates; main results are expected from 2028.

Trial Registration Number The RAINBO program is registered at clinicaltrials.gov ([NCT05255653][1]).

   abstract = {on behalf of the TransPORTEC consortium abstract PURPOSE The randomized Adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Versus Radiotherapy Alone in Women With High-Risk Endometrial Cancer (PORTEC-3) trial investigated the benefit of combined adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CTRT) versus radiotherapy alone (RT) for women with high-risk endometrial cancer (EC). Because The Cancer Genome Atlas defined an EC molecular classification with strong prognostic value, we investigated prognosis and impact of chemotherapy for each molecular subgroup using tissue samples from PORTEC-3 trial participants. METHODS Paraffin-embedded tissues of 423 consenting patients were collected. Immunohistochemistry for p53 and mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, and DNA sequencing for POLE exonuclease domain were done to classify tumors as p53 abnormal (p53abn), POLE-ultramutated (POLEmut), MMR-deficient (MMRd), or no specific molecular profile (NSMP). The primary end point was recurrence-free survival (RFS). Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox model were used for analysis. RESULTS Molecular analysis was successful in 410 high-risk EC (97%), identifying the 4 subgroups: p53abn EC (n 5 93; 23%), POLEmut (n 5 51; 12%), MMRd (n 5 137; 33%), and NSMP (n 5 129; 32%). Five-year RFS was 48% for patients with p53abn EC, 98% for POLEmut EC, 72% for MMRd EC, and 74% for NSMP EC (P , .001). The 5-year RFS with CTRT versus RT for p53abn EC was 59% versus 36% (P 5 .019); 100% versus 97% for patients with POLEmut EC (P 5 .637); 68% versus 76% (P 5 .428) for MMRd EC; and 80% versus 68% (P 5 .243) for NSMP EC. CONCLUSION Molecular classification has strong prognostic value in high-risk EC, with significantly improved RFS with adjuvant CTRT for p53abn tumors, regardless of histologic type. Patients with POLEmut EC had an excellent RFS in both trial arms. EC molecular classification should be incorporated in the risk stratification of these patients as well as in future trials to target specific subgroups of patients.},

   abstract = {Background: When determining adjuvant treatment for endometrial cancer, the decision typically relies on factors such as cancer stage, histologic grade, subtype, and a few histopathologic markers. The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed molecular subtyping of endometrial cancer, which can provide more accurate prognostic information and guide personalized treatment plans. Objective: To summarize the expression and molecular basis of the main biomarkers of endometrial cancer. Search Strategy: PubMed was searched from January 2000 to March 2023. Selection Criteria: Studies evaluating molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer and implications for adjuvant treatment strategies. Data Collection and Analysis: Three authors independently performed a comprehensive literature search, collected and extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. Main Results: We summarized the molecular subtyping of endometrial cancer, including mismatch repair deficient, high microsatellite instability, polymerase epsilon (POLE) exonuclease domain mutated, TP53 gene mutation, and non-specific molecular spectrum. We also summarized planned and ongoing clinical trials and common therapy methods in endometrial cancer. POLE mutated endometrial cancer consistently exhibits favorable patient outcomes, regardless of adjuvant therapy. Genomic similarities between p53 abnormality endometrial cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer suggested possible overlapping treatment strategies. High levels of immune checkpoint molecules, such as programmed cell death 1 and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 can counterbalance mismatch repair deficient endometrial cancer immune phenotype. Hormonal treatment is an appealing option for high-risk non-specific molecular spectrum endometrial cancers, which are typically endometrioid and hormone receptor positive. Combining clinical and pathologic characteristics to guide treatment decisions for patients, including concurrent radiochemotherapy, chemotherapy, inhibitor therapy, endocrine therapy, and immunotherapy, might improve the management of endometrial cancer and provide more effective treatment options for patients. Conclusions: We have characterized the molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer and discuss their value in terms of a patient-tailored therapy in order to prevent significant under- or overtreatment.},

@article{Jungen2023,
   abstract = {Introduction: Over the years, the molecular classification of endometrial carcinoma has evolved significantly. Both POLEmut and MMRdef cases share tumor biological similarities like high tumor mutational burden and induce strong lymphatic reactions. While therefore use case scenarios for pretesting with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to replace molecular analysis did not show promising results, such testing may be warranted in cases where an inverse prediction, such as that of POLEwt, is being considered. For that reason we used a spatial digital pathology method to quantitatively examine CD3+ and CD8+ immune infiltrates in comparison to conventional histopathological parameters, prognostics and as potential pretest before molecular analysis. Methods: We applied a four-color multiplex immunofluorescence assay for pan-cytokeratin, CD3, CD8, and DAPI on 252 endometrial carcinomas as testing and compared it to further 213 cases as validation cohort from a similar multiplexing assay. We quantitatively assessed immune infiltrates in microscopic distances within the carcinoma, in a close distance of 50 microns, and in more distant areas. Results: Regarding prognostics, high CD3+ and CD8+ densities in intra-tumoral and close subregions pointed toward a favorable outcome. However, TCGA subtyping outperforms prognostication of CD3 and CD8 based parameters. Different CD3+ and CD8+ densities were significantly associated with the TCGA subgroups, but not consistently for histopathological parameter. In the testing cohort, intra-tumoral densities of less than 50 intra-tumoral CD8+ cells/mm2 were the most suitable parameter to assume a POLEwt, irrespective of an MMRdef, NSMP or p53abn background. An application to the validation cohort corroborates these findings with an overall sensitivity of 95.5%. Discussion: Molecular confirmation of POLEmut cases remains the gold standard. Even if CD3+ and CD8+ cell densities appeared less prognostic than TCGA, low intra-tumoral CD8+ values predict a POLE wild-type at substantial percentage rates, but not vice versa. This inverse correlation might be useful to increase pretest probabilities in consecutive POLE testing. Molecular subtyping is currently not conducted in one-third of cases deemed low-risk based on conventional clinical and histopathological parameters. However, this percentage could potentially be increased to two-thirds by excluding sequencing of predicted POLE wild-type cases, which could be determined through precise quantification of intra-tumoral CD8+ cells.},

   abstract = {These authors contributed equally to this work. Background: We have previously developed and confirmed a pragmatic molecular classifier for endometrial cancers; ProMisE (Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer). Inspired by the Cancer Genome Atlas, ProMisE identifies four prognostically distinct molecular subtypes and can be applied to diagnostic specimens (biopsy/curettings) enabling earlier informed decision-making. We have strictly adhered to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines for the development of genomic biomarkers, and herein present the final validation step of a locked-down classifier before clinical application. Patients and methods: We assessed a retrospective cohort of women from the Tü bingen University Women's Hospital treated for endometrial carcinoma between 2003 and 2013. Primary outcomes of overall, disease-specific, and progression-free survival were evaluated for clinical, pathological, and molecular features. Results: Complete clinical and molecular data were evaluable from 452 women. Patient age ranged from 29 to 93 (median 65) years, and 87.8% cases were endometrioid histotype. Grade distribution included 282 (62.4%) G1, 75 (16.6%) G2, and 95 (21.0%) G3 tumors. 276 (61.1%) patients had stage IA disease, with the remaining stage IB [89 (19.7%)], stage II [26 (5.8%)], and stage III/IV [61 (13.5%)]. ProMisE molecular classification yielded 127 (28.1%) MMR-D, 42 (9.3%) POLE, 55 (12.2%) p53abn, and 228 (50.4%) p53wt. ProMisE was a prognostic marker for progression-free (P ¼ 0.001) and disease-specific (P ¼ 0.03) survival even after adjusting for known risk factors. Concordance between diagnostic and surgical specimens was highly favorable; accuracy 0.91, j 0.88. Discussion: We have developed, confirmed, and now validated a pragmatic molecular classification tool (ProMisE) that provides consistent categorization of tumors and identifies four distinct prognostic molecular subtypes. ProMisE can be applied to diagnostic samples and thus could be used to inform surgical procedure(s) and/or need for adjuvant therapy. Based on the IOM guidelines this classifier is now ready for clinical evaluation through prospective clinical trials.},

   abstract = {Objective: Despite its generally favorable prognosis at primary diagnosis, recurrence of endometrial cancer remains an important clinical challenge. The aim of this study was to analyze the value of molecular classification in recurrent endometrial cancer. Methods: This study included patients with recurrent endometrial cancer who underwent primary surgical treatment between 2004 and 2015 at the Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden and the Bern University Hospital, Switzerland (KImBer cohort) with molecular classification of the primary tumor. Results: Out of 594 molecularly classified endometrial cancer patients, 101 patients experienced recurrence, consisting of 2 POLEmut, 33 MMRd, 30 p53abn, and 36 NSMP tumors. Mean age at recurrence was 71 years and mean follow-up was 54 months. Overall, median time to first recurrence was 16 months (95% CI 12–20); with the shortest median time in MMRd patients, with 13 months (95% CI 5–21). The pattern of recurrence was distinct among molecular subgroups: MMRd tumors experienced more locoregional, while p53abn cases showed more abdominal recurrences (P = .042). Median survival after recurrence was best for MMRd cases (43 months, 95% CI 11–76), compared to 39 months (95% CI 21–57) and 10 months (95% CI 7–13) for the NSMP and p53abn cases respectively (log-rank, P = .001). Conclusion: Molecular classification is a significant indicator of survival after recurrence in endometrial cancer patients, and patterns of recurrence differ by molecular subgroups. While MMRd endometrial cancer show more locoregional recurrence and the best survival rates after recurrence, p53abn patients experience abdominal recurrence more often and had the worst prognosis of all recurrent patients.},

   abstract = {Background: Inspired by the molecular classification of endometrial carcinoma (EC) proposed by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA), we investigated tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive T-cell as well as DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein and p53 protein expression, and we developed a new classification system for ECs to predict patients’ prognosis using immunohistochemical methods. Methods: The study included 128 patients with ECs who underwent surgery. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of the tumor were stained using antibodies against MMR protein, p53, and CD8. Cases were stratified into four classes by a sequential algorithm. An immunohistochemical classification system for ECs (ICEC) was created, including HCD8, MMR-D, LCD8, and p53 LCD8. Results: In ICEC, 16 cases (12.5%), 27 cases (21.09%), 67 cases (52.34%), and 18 cases (14.06%) belonged to HCD8, MMR-D, LCD8, and p53 LCD8, respectively. ICEC did not show any correlation with clinical stage, lymphovascular space invasion, or lymph node metastasis. However, the p53 LCD8 class contained a significantly higher proportion of G3 ECs and serous carcinoma (p < 0.0001). ICEC showed prognostic significance in overall survival (OS) (p < 0.0001) and disease-free survival (DFS) (p < 0.0001). The class of p53 LCD8 showed the worst prognosis among the classes. Conclusions: ICEC classification is useful in predicting the prognosis of ECs.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Many advances in the understanding of the pathologic and molecular features of endometrial cancer have occurred since the FIGO staging was last updated in 2009. Substantially more outcome and biological behavior data are now available regarding the several histological types. Molecular and genetic findings have accelerated since the publication of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and provide improved clarity on the diverse biological nature of this collection of endometrial cancers and their differing prognostic outcomes. The goals of the new staging system are to better define these prognostic groups and create substages that indicate more appropriate surgical, radiation, and systemic therapies. Methods: The FIGO Women's Cancer Committee appointed a Subcommittee on Endometrial Cancer Staging in October 2021, represented by the authors. Since then, the committee members have met frequently and reviewed new and established evidence on the treatment, prognosis, and survival of endometrial cancer. Based on these data, opportunities for improvements in the categorization and stratification of these factors were identified in each of the four stages. Data and analyses from the molecular and histological classifications performed and published in the recently developed ESGO/ESTRO/ESP guidelines were used as a template for adding the new subclassifications to the proposed molecular and histological staging system. Results: Based on the existing evidence, the substages were defined as follows:. Stage I (IA1): non-aggressive histological type of endometrial carcinoma limited to a polyp or confined to the endometrium; (IA2) non-aggressive histological types of endometrium involving less than 50% of the myometrium with no or focal lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) as defined by WHO criteria; (IA3) low-grade endometrioid carcinomas limited to the uterus with simultaneous low-grade endometrioid ovarian involvement; (IB) non-aggressive histological types involving 50% or more of the myometrium with no LVSI or focal LVSI; (IC) aggressive histological types, i.e. serous, high-grade endometrioid, clear cell, carcinosarcomas, undifferentiated, mixed, and other unusual types without any myometrial invasion. Stage II (IIA): non-aggressive histological types that infiltrate the cervical stroma; (IIB) non-aggressive histological types that have substantial LVSI; or (IIC) aggressive histological types with any myometrial invasion. Stage III (IIIA): differentiating between adnexal versus uterine serosa infiltration; (IIIB) infiltration of vagina/parametria and pelvic peritoneal metastasis; and (IIIC) refinements for lymph node metastasis to pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, including micrometastasis and macrometastasis. Stage IV (IVA): locally advanced disease infiltrating the bladder or rectal mucosa; (IVB) extrapelvic peritoneal metastasis; and (IVC) distant metastasis. The performance of complete molecular classification (POLEmut, MMRd, NSMP, p53abn) is encouraged in all endometrial cancers. If the molecular subtype is known, this is recorded in the FIGO stage by the addition of “m” for molecular classification, and a subscript indicating the specific molecular subtype. When molecular classification reveals p53abn or POLEmut status in Stages I and II, this results in upstaging or downstaging of the disease (IICmp53abn or IAmPOLEmut). Summary: The updated 2023 staging of endometrial cancer includes the various histological types, tumor patterns, and molecular classification to better reflect the improved understanding of the complex nature of the several types of endometrial carcinoma and their underlying biologic behavior. The changes incorporated in the 2023 staging system should provide a more evidence-based context for treatment recommendations and for the more refined future collection of outcome and survival data.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Classification of endometrial carcinomas (ECs) by morphologic features is irreproducible and imperfectly reflects tumor biology. The authors developed the Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer (ProMisE), a molecular classification system based on The Cancer Genome Atlas genomic subgroups, and sought to confirm both feasibility and prognostic ability in a new, large cohort of ECs. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the presence or absence of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (to identify MMR deficiency [MMR-D]), sequencing for polymerase-ɛ (POLE) exonuclease domain mutations (POLE EDMs), and IHC for tumor protein 53 (p53) (wild type vs null/missense mutations; p53 wt and p53 abn, respectively) were performed on 319 new EC samples. Subgroups were characterized and assessed relative to outcomes. The prognostic ability of ProMisE was compared with that of current risk-stratification systems (European Society of Medical Oncology [ESMO]). RESULTS: ProMisE decision-tree classification achieved categorization of all cases and identified 4 prognostic subgroups with distinct overall, disease-specific, and progression-free survival (P <.001). Tumors with POLE EDMs had the most favorable prognosis, and those with p53 abn the worst prognosis, and separation of the 2 middle survival curves (p53 wt and MMR-D) was observed. There were no significant differences in survival between the ESMO low-risk and intermediate-risk groups. ProMisE improved the ability to discriminate outcomes compared with ESMO risk stratification. There was substantial overlap (89%) between the p53 abn and high-risk ESMO subgroups; but, otherwise, there were no predictable associations between molecular and ESMO risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular classification of ECs can be achieved using clinically applicable methods and provides independent prognostic information beyond established clinicopathologic risk factors available at diagnosis. Consistent, biologically relevant categorization enables stratification for clinical trials and/or targeted therapy, identification of women who are at increased risk of having Lynch syndrome, and may guide clinical management.

   abstract = {We performed an integrated genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of 373 endometrial carcinomas using array-and sequencing-based technologies. Uterine serous tumours and ∼25% of high-grade endometrioid tumours had extensive copy number alterations, few DNA methylation changes, low oestrogen receptor/progesterone receptor levels, and frequent TP53 mutations. Most endometrioid tumours had few copy number alterations or TP53 mutations, but frequent mutations in PTEN, CTNNB1, PIK3CA, ARID1A and KRAS and novel mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex gene ARID5B. A subset of endometrioid tumours that we identified had a markedly increased transversion mutation frequency and newly identified hotspot mutations in POLE. Our results classified endometrial cancers into four categories: POLE ultramutated, microsatellite instability hypermutated, copy-number low, and copy-number high. Uterine serous carcinomas share genomic features with ovarian serous and basal-like breast carcinomas. We demonstrated that the genomic features of endometrial carcinomas permit a reclassification that may affect post-surgical adjuvant treatment for women with aggressive tumours. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Using surrogate approaches, the molecular classification has been demonstrated to be prognostic across EC patients and to have predictive implications. Starting in 2020, the molecular classification has been incorporated into multiple guidelines as part of the risk assessment and most recently into the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging.

   abstract = {Ovarian cancer is an immune reactive malignancy with a complex immune suppressive network that blunts successful immune eradication. This suppressive microenvironment may be mediated by recruitment or induction of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Our study sought to investigate the association of tumor-infiltrating CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs, and other immune factors, with clinical outcome in serous ovarian cancer patients. We performed immunofluorescence and quantification of intraepithelial tumor-infiltrating triple positive Tregs (CD4+CD25 +FOXP3+), as well as CD4+CD25 +FOXP3-, CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in tumor specimens from 52 patients with high stage serous ovarian carcinoma. Thirty-one of the patients had good survival (i.e. > 60 months) and 21 had poor survival of < 18 months. Total cell counts as well as cell ratios were compared among these two outcome groups. The total numbers of CD4 +CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs, CD4+CD25 +FOXP3-, CD3+ and CD8+ cells were not significantly different between the groups. However, higher ratios of CD8+/CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Treg, CD8 +/CD4+ and CD8/CD4+CD25+FOXP3- cells were seen in the good outcome group when compared to the patients with poor outcome. These data show for the first time that the ratios of CD8+ to both CD4 +CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs and CD4+CD25 +FOXP3- T cells are associated with disease outcome in ovarian cancer. The association being apparent in ratios rather than absolute count of T cells suggests that the effector/suppressor ratio may be a more important indicator of outcome than individual cell count. Thus, immunotherapy strategies that modify the ratio of CD4+CD25+FOXP3 + Tregs or CD4+CD25+FOXP3- T cells to CD8+ effector cells may be useful in improving outcomes in ovarian cancer. © 2013 Preston et al.},

   abstract = {Background: Uterine serous carcinomas represent 10% of uterine carcinomas but account for nearly 40% of deaths from the disease. Improved molecular characterization of these tumors is instrumental in guiding targeted treatment and improving outcomes. This study assessed the genomic instability score (GIS), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patients with USC. Methods: A retrospective cohort study evaluated patients with USC following staging surgery. The GIS and TMB were determined from archived specimens. We evaluated the tumoral expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, and CD68 using immunohistochemistry. T-tests were used to assess associations of TILs with the GIS. Results: We evaluated 53 patients with USC. The median GIS was 31 (range: 0–52) and a higher GIS was not associated with progression-free (PFS) or overall survival (OS). The median TMB was 1.35 mt/Mb; patients with TMB > 1.35 mt/Mb had improved PFS and OS (p = 0.005; p = 0.002, respectively). Tumors with increased CD3+ and CD4+ immune cells had a higher mean GIS (p = 0.013, p = 0.002). Conclusions: TMB > 1.35 mt/Mb was associated with improved survival in USC patients, whereas the GIS was not. Lower TMB thresholds may provide prognostic value for less immunogenic tumors such as USC. In this limited cohort, we observed that increased TIL populations were correlated with a higher GIS.},

To compare the frequencies of somatic homologous recombination (HR) gene mutations identified in next-generation sequencing (NGS) genomic profiling of uterine serous carcinomas (USCs) and high-grade se-rous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs). Methods. Data for this analysis was obtained from AACR Project GENIE, a multi-institutional dataset of clinical-grade NGS genomic profiling results for many cancer sites and histologic subtypes, through cBioPortal. Patient/specimen groups used for analysis were USC and HGSOC. 14 HR genes were queried for each group with respect to mutation frequency. For each HR gene, the difference in mutation frequency between the two groups was evaluated using Fisher's exact test. The threshold for statistical significance was p-value < .05. Results. In the USC group, there were 457 samples from 451 patients. In the HGSOC group, there were 1537 samples from 1515 patients. The most frequently mutated HR gene for USC was BRCA2 (4.84%) and for HGSOC was BRCA1 (9.07%). Mutation frequency was significantly different between USC and HGSOC for BRCA 1 (p < .001) and BRCA2 (p = .0379). For the 12 non-BRCA HR genes, mutation frequency was not significantly different between USC and HGSOC. The rate of patients with at least one HR gene mutation in their profiled tumor was 16.85% for USC and 25.21% of HGSOC. Most USC patients with a somatic HR mutation had only one HR gene mutated. Conclusions. Somatic HR gene mutations were commonly identified in NGS genomic profiling of USC. Mutation frequencies for non-BRCA HR genes were not significantly different between USC and HGSOC. These data add to the growing rationale for HR deficiency tumor testing and targeting (e.g., with PARP inhibitors) in future clinical trial development for women with USC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Dostarlimab is an immune-checkpoint inhibitor that targets the programmed cell death 1 receptor. The combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy may have synergistic effects in the treatment of endometrial cancer. METHODS We conducted a phase 3, global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible patients with primary advanced stage III or IV or first recurrent endometrial cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either dostarlimab (500 mg) or placebo, plus carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve, 5 mg per milliliter per minute) and paclitaxel (175 mg per square meter of body-surface area), every 3 weeks (six cycles), followed by dostarlimab (1000 mg) or placebo every 6 weeks for up to 3 years. The primary end points were progression-free survival as assessed by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, and overall survival. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS Of the 494 patients who underwent randomization, 118 (23.9%) had mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR), microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. In the dMMR-MSI-H population, estimated progression-free survival at 24 months was 61.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46.3 to 73.4) in the dostarlimab group and 15.7% (95% CI, 7.2 to 27.0) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.50; P<0.001). In the overall population, progression-free survival at 24 months was 36.1% (95% CI, 29.3 to 42.9) in the dostarlimab group and 18.1% (95% CI, 13.0 to 23.9) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.80; P<0.001). Overall survival at 24 months was 71.3% (95% CI, 64.5 to 77.1) with dostarlimab and 56.0% (95% CI, 48.9 to 62.5) with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.87). The most common adverse events that occurred or worsened during treatment were nausea (53.9% of the patients in the dostarlimab group and 45.9% of those in the placebo group), alopecia (53.5% and 50.0%), and fatigue (51.9% and 54.5%). Severe and serious adverse events were more frequent in the dostarlimab group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS Dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel significantly increased progression-free survival among patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, with a substantial benefit in the dMMR-MSI-H population.

   abstract = {Optimum risk stratification in early-stage endometrial cancer combines clinicopathologic factors and the molecular endometrial cancer classification defined by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). It is unclear whether analysis of intratumoral immune infiltrate improves this. We developed a machine-learning, image-based algorithm to quantify density of CD8þ and CD103þ immune cells in tumor epithelium and stroma in 695 stage I endometrioid endometrial cancers from the PORTEC-1 and -2 trials. The relationship between immune cell density and clinicopathologic/molecular factors was analyzed by hierarchical clustering and multiple regression. The prognostic value of immune infiltrate by cell type and location was analyzed by univariable and multivariable Cox regression, incorporating the molecular endometrial cancer classification. Tumor-infiltrating immune cell density varied substantially between cases, and more modestly by immune cell type and location. Clustering revealed three groups with high, intermediate, and low densities, with highly significant variation in the proportion of molecular endometrial cancer subgroups between them. Univariable analysis revealed intraepithelial CD8þ cell density as the strongest predictor of endometrial cancer recurrence; multivariable analysis confirmed this was independent of pathologic factors and molecular subgroup. Exploratory analysis suggested this association was not uniform across molecular subgroups, but greatest in tumors with mutant p53 and absent in DNA mismatch repair-deficient cancers. Thus, this work identified that quantification of intraepithelial CD8þ cells improved upon the prognostic utility of the molecular endometrial cancer classification in early-stage endometrial cancer.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Despite the tissue-agnostic approval of pembrolizumab in mismatch repair deficient (MMRD) solid tumors, important unanswered questions remain about the role of immune checkpoint blockade in mismatch repair-proficient (MMRP) and -deficient endometrial cancer (EC). METHODS: This phase II study evaluated the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab in two cohorts of patients with EC: (1) MMRD/POLE (polymerase e) cohort, as defined by immunohistochemical (IHC) loss of expression of one or more mismatch repair (MMR) proteins and/or documented mutation in the exonuclease domain of POLE; and (2) MMRP cohort with normal IHC expression of all MMR proteins. Coprimary end points were objective response (OR) and progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6). Avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenously was administered every 2 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were enrolled. No patient with POLE-mutated tumor was enrolled in the MMRD cohort, and all MMRP tumors were not POLE-mutated. The MMRP cohort was closed at the first stage because of futility: Only one of 16 patients exhibited both OR and PFS6 responses. The MMRD cohort met the predefined primary end point of four ORs after accrual of only 17 patients; of 15 patients who initiated avelumab, four exhibited OR (one complete response, three partial responses; OR rate, 26.7%; 95% CI, 7.8% to 55.1%) and six (including all four ORs) PFS6 responses (PFS6, 40.0%; 95% CI, 16.3% to 66.7%), four of which are ongoing as of data cutoff date. Responses were observed in the absence of PD-L1 expression. IHC captured all cases of MMRD subsequently determined by polymerase chain reaction or genomically via targeted sequencing. CONCLUSION: Avelumab exhibited promising activity in MMRD EC regardless of PD-L1 status. IHC for MMR assessment is a useful tool for patient selection. The activity of avelumab in MMRP/non-POLE-mutated ECs was low.},

   abstract = {Over the past decade, our understanding of endometrial cancer has changed dramatically from the two-tiered clinicopathologic classification system of type I and type II endometrial cancer through to the four distinct molecular subtypes identified by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in 2013. In both systems there is a small subset of endometrial cancers (serous histotype/high numbers of somatic copy number abnormalities) that account for a disproportionately high percentage of endometrial cancer related deaths. This subset can be identified in routine clinical practice by first identifying the approximately one-third of endometrial cancers that are either ultramutated/ POLE mut tumors, with pathogenic mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLE , or hypermutated/MMRd tumors, with loss of DNA mismatch repair. Immunostaining for p53 stratifies the remaining endometrial cancers into those with wild-type staining pattern and those with mutant pattern staining (p53abn endometrial cancer). This latter group of p53abn endometrial cancer is the subject of this review. Most p53abn endometrial cancers are serous type and high grade, but it also includes other histotypes and lower grade tumors, and has consistently been associated with the poorest clinical outcomes. Although it only accounts for 15% of all endometrial cancer cases, it is responsible for 50–70% of endometrial cancer mortality. A better understanding of the molecular alterations in the p53abn subgroup, beyond the ubiquitous and definitional TP53 mutations, is required so we can identify better treatments for these most aggressive endometrial cancers. Recent evidence has shown improved survival outcomes with the addition of chemotherapy compared with radiation alone in p53abn endometrial cancers. Opportunities for targeted therapy for p53abn endometrial cancers also exist with a proportion of p53abn endometrial cancers known to have homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) or human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) overexpression/amplification. This review will provide an overview of our current understanding of p53abn endometrial cancer.},

Here, to decode this complexity, we derived copy number signatures from shallow whole-genome sequencing of 117 high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cases, which were validated on 527 independent cases. We show that HGSOC comprises a continuum of genomes shaped by multiple mutational processes that result in known patterns of genomic aberration. Copy number signature exposures at diagnosis predict both overall survival and the probability of platinum-resistant relapse. Measurement of signature exposures provides a rational framework to choose combination treatments that target multiple mutational processes.

   abstract = {Objective: Host antitumor immune responses are associated with many types of immune cells and soluble components. In particular, CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a central role. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been reported to induce tumor immune tolerance in various cancers. In the present study, we evaluated lymphocytic infiltration in endometrial cancer tissue to clarify its relationship with clinicopathological factors and the prognosis of patients. Methods: The study included 53 patients whose condition was diagnosed as endometrial cancer between 1994 and 2004 at Keio University hospital. Using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of the uterus, immunohistochemistry was performed with antihuman CD8, antihuman CD4, and antihuman FOXP3 primary antibodies, and the binding sites of the antibodies were visualized using fluorescence-conjugate secondary antibodies. CD4 +FOXP3 + cells were identified as Tregs in this study. The numbers of CD8 + cells, CD4 +cells, and Tregs as well as the Treg/CD8 + and Treg/CD4 + ratios were analyzed to evaluate the relationship between clinicopathological factors and patient prognosis. Results: Of the 53 patients studied, 50.9% of them had early-stage disease, 49.1% had advanced stage disease, 47.2% had well-differentiated cancer (grade [G] 1), 24.5% had moderately differentiated cancer (G2), and 28.3% had poorly differentiated cancer (G3). The CD8 + and CD4 + cell counts, Treg count, and Treg/CD8 + and Treg/CD4 + ratios were significantly higher in the patients with advanced poorly differentiated carcinomas and with positive lymphovascular space invasion than in those with early well-differentiated carcinomas and with negative lymphovascular space invasion. In disease-free survival, the prognosis of the patients with high Treg counts and Treg/CD8 + ratios was significantly worse than that of the patients with low Treg counts and Treg/CD8 + ratios (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The Treg count and Treg/CD8 + ratio may be new prognostic factors for endometrial cancer. Copyright © by IGCS and ESGO.},

   abstract = {Background:Classification of endometrial carcinomas (ECs) by morphologic features is inconsistent, and yields limited prognostic and predictive information. A new system for classification based on the molecular categories identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas is proposed.Methods:Genomic data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) support classification of endometrial carcinomas into four prognostically significant subgroups; we used the TCGA data set to develop surrogate assays that could replicate the TCGA classification, but without the need for the labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive genomic methodology. Combinations of the most relevant assays were carried forward and tested on a new independent cohort of 152 endometrial carcinoma cases, and molecular vs clinical risk group stratification was compared.Results:Replication of TCGA survival curves was achieved with statistical significance using multiple different molecular classification models (16 total tested). Internal validation supported carrying forward a classifier based on the following components: mismatch repair protein immunohistochemistry, POLE mutational analysis and p53 immunohistochemistry as a surrogate for 'copy-number' status. The proposed molecular classifier was associated with clinical outcomes, as was stage, grade, lymph-vascular space invasion, nodal involvement and adjuvant treatment. In multivariable analysis both molecular classification and clinical risk groups were associated with outcomes, but differed greatly in composition of cases within each category, with half of POLE and mismatch repair loss subgroups residing within the clinically defined 'high-risk' group. Combining the molecular classifier with clinicopathologic features or risk groups provided the highest C-index for discrimination of outcome survival curves.Conclusions:Molecular classification of ECs can be achieved using clinically applicable methods on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, and provides independent prognostic information beyond established risk factors. This pragmatic molecular classification tool has potential to be used routinely in guiding treatment for individuals with endometrial carcinoma and in stratifying cases in future clinical trials.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Tumors with high mutation load are thought to engender stronger immune responses, which in turn promote prolonged patient survival. To investigate this, we assessed tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and immunosuppressive factors across the 4 molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer, which have characteristic mutation rates ranging from low to ultra-high. Experimental Design: A total of 460 endometrial cancers were stratified by ProMisE (Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier in Endometrial cancer) into 4 molecular subtypes: mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd), POLE mutant (POLE), p53 abnormal (p53abn), and p53 wild-type (p53wt). Immune markers (CD3, CD8, CD79a, CD138, PD-1, PD-L1, FoxP3, IDO-1) were quantified by multiplex IHC and tested for associations with ProMisE subtype, survival, and other clinicopathologic parameters. Results: Two major TIL patterns were observed. TILhigh tumors harbored dense T- and B-lineage infiltrates and multiple immunosuppressive features and were common in molecular subtypes associated with high mutation load (MMRd and POLE); however, equally strong responses were seen in significant numbers of p53abn and p53wt tumors, which have characteristically low mutation loads. TILlow tumors were generally devoid of immunologic features and were more prevalent in p53abn and p53wt endometrial cancers, yet were also seen in MMRd and POLE subtypes. In multivariable models involving ProMisE subtype, T-cell markers, and TIL clusters, only ProMisE showed independent prognostic significance. Conclusions: Immune response correlates with endometrial cancer molecular subtype but does not carry independent prognostic significance. Profound variation in immune response is seen across and within endometrial cancer molecular subtypes, suggesting that assessment of immune response rather than molecular subtype may better predict response to immunotherapy.},

Here, we investigate the role of B-cells and TLS in endometrial cancer (EC). Single cell RNA-sequencing of B-cells shows presence of naïve B-cells, cycling/germinal center B-cells and antibody-secreting cells. Differential gene expression analysis shows association of TLS with L1CAM overexpression. Immunohistochemistry and co-immunofluorescence show L1CAM expression in mature TLS, independent of L1CAM expression in the tumor. Using L1CAM as a marker, 378 of the 411 molecularly classified ECs from the PORTEC-3 biobank are evaluated, TLS are found in 19%. L1CAM expressing TLS are most common in mismatch-repair deficient (29/127, 23%) and polymerase-epsilon mutant EC (24/47, 51%). Multivariable Cox regression analysis shows strong favorable prognostic impact of TLS, independent of clinicopathological and molecular factors. Our data suggests a pivotal role of TLS in outcome of EC patients, and establishes L1CAM as a simple biomarker. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are associated with a reduced risk of cancer recurrence and improved response to immune checkpoint blockade in several tumor types. Here the authors identify L1CAM as a marker for mature TLS and show that the presence of TLS is associated with favorable prognosis in patients with endometrial cancer from the PORTEC-3 trial.},

   abstract = {Background: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) may be useful prognostic indicators in endometrial cancer. However, standardized assessment methods and the prognostic roles of these cells in different stage groups are unclear. Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 107 endometrioid-type endometrial carcinomas (EECs) comprising 60 stage IB and 47 stage IIIC or IVB cases were evaluated. CD3+ TILs, CD8+ TILs, CD68+ TAMs, and CD163+ TAMs were detected by immunohistochemistry, and their densities were evaluated by semiquantitative and quantitative methods. TILs within tumor epithelial cell nests (E-TILs) and those within the stroma at the invasive front (S-TILs) were evaluated separately for CD3+ and CD8+ cells. The “TIL score” was defined as the sum of semiquantitative scores of CD3+ E-TILs, CD3+ S-TILs, CD8+ E-TILs, and CD8+ S-TILs. For TAMs, the area of CD68+ and CD163+ cells in the invasive margin were semiquantitatively and quantitatively evaluated. Clinicopathological and prognostic implications of TILs and TAMs in stage IB and IIIC/IVB EECs were examined by Cox univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: By Cox univariate analyses, semiquantitatively low CD3+ E-TILs, low CD8+ E-TILs, and low “TIL score” were significantly correlated with worse prognosis in stage IB patients (P = 0.011, 0.040, and 0.039, respectively). Likewise, low CD3+ E-TILs and low CD8+ E-TILs, by both semiquantitative (P = 0.011 and 0.0051) and quantitative evaluations (P < 0.0001, and P = 0.0015) and low “TIL score” (P = 0.020) were significantly correlated with worse prognosis in stage IIIC/IVB patients. By Cox multivariate analyses, semiquantitatively low CD3+ E-TILs and low CD8+ E-TILs, low “TIL score”, and quantitatively low CD3+ E-TILs and low CD8+ E-TILs were independent worse prognostic factors in stage IIIC/IVB (P = 0.0011, 0.0053, 0.012, < 0.0001, and < 0.0001, respectively). CD68+ or CD163+ TAMs were not correlated with prognosis in any patients. Conclusions: Both semiquantitatively and quantitatively low E-TILs, are correlated with worse prognosis in both early and advanced stage patients with EECs. In particular, CD3+ E-TILs and CD8+ E-TILs are potentially useful prognostic markers in patients with EEC regardless of the stage.},

   abstract = {Standard molecular classification of endometrial cancers (EC) is now endorsed by the WHO and identifies p53-abnormal (p53abn) EC as the subgroup with the poorest prognosis and the most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemo(radio)therapy. P53abn EC are POLE wildtype, mismatch repair proficient and show abnormal immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for p53. Correct interpretation of routinely performed p53 IHC has therefore become of paramount importance. We aimed to comprehensively investigate abnormal p53 IHC patterns and their relation to clinicopathological and molecular features. Tumor material of 411 molecularly classified high-risk EC from consenting patients from the PORTEC-3 clinical trial were collected. p53 IHC was successful in 408 EC and was considered abnormal when the tumor showed a mutant expression pattern (including subclonal): overexpression, null or cytoplasmic. The presence of pathogenic mutations was determined by next generation sequencing (NGS). Abnormal p53 expression was observed in 131/408 (32%) tumors. The most common abnormal p53 IHC pattern was overexpression (n = 89, 68%), followed by null (n = 12, 9%) and cytoplasmic (n = 3, 2%). Subclonal abnormal p53 staining was observed in 27 cases (21%), which was frequently but not exclusively, associated with POLE mutations and/or MMRd (n = 22/27; p < 0.001). Agreement between p53 IHC and TP53 NGS was observed in 90.7%, resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of 83.6% and 94.3%, respectively. Excluding POLEmut and MMRd EC, as per the WHO-endorsed algorithm, increased the accuracy to 94.5% with sensitivity and specificity of 95.0% and 94.1%, respectively. Our data shows that awareness of the abnormal p53 IHC patterns are prerequisites for correct EC molecular classification. Subclonal abnormal p53 expression is a strong indicator for POLEmut and/or MMRd EC. No significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed among the abnormal p53 IHC patterns. Our data support use of the WHO-endorsed algorithm and combining the different abnormal p53 IHC patterns into one diagnostic entity (p53abn EC).},

   abstract = {Background: When determining adjuvant treatment for endometrial cancer, the decision typically relies on factors such as cancer stage, histologic grade, subtype, and a few histopathologic markers. The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed molecular subtyping of endometrial cancer, which can provide more accurate prognostic information and guide personalized treatment plans. Objective: To summarize the expression and molecular basis of the main biomarkers of endometrial cancer. Search Strategy: PubMed was searched from January 2000 to March 2023. Selection Criteria: Studies evaluating molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer and implications for adjuvant treatment strategies. Data Collection and Analysis: Three authors independently performed a comprehensive literature search, collected and extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. Main Results: We summarized the molecular subtyping of endometrial cancer, including mismatch repair deficient, high microsatellite instability, polymerase epsilon (POLE) exonuclease domain mutated, TP53 gene mutation, and non-specific molecular spectrum. We also summarized planned and ongoing clinical trials and common therapy methods in endometrial cancer. POLE mutated endometrial cancer consistently exhibits favorable patient outcomes, regardless of adjuvant therapy. Genomic similarities between p53 abnormality endometrial cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer suggested possible overlapping treatment strategies. High levels of immune checkpoint molecules, such as programmed cell death 1 and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 can counterbalance mismatch repair deficient endometrial cancer immune phenotype. Hormonal treatment is an appealing option for high-risk non-specific molecular spectrum endometrial cancers, which are typically endometrioid and hormone receptor positive. Combining clinical and pathologic characteristics to guide treatment decisions for patients, including concurrent radiochemotherapy, chemotherapy, inhibitor therapy, endocrine therapy, and immunotherapy, might improve the management of endometrial cancer and provide more effective treatment options for patients. Conclusions: We have characterized the molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer and discuss their value in terms of a patient-tailored therapy in order to prevent significant under- or overtreatment.},

This study aims to determine the prognostic value of CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL), FoxP3+ regulatory T-lymphocytes (Treg) and CD45R0+ memory T-lymphocytes in endometrial cancer. Methods: The number of tumor-infiltrating CD8+, FoxP3+, and CD45R0+ T-lymphocytes was determined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays containing tumor material from 368 FIGO stage I-IV endometrial cancer patients. Results from immunohistochemistry were correlated with clinicopathological parameters and survival. Results: High numbers of intra-tumoral CD8+ T-lymphocytes, a high CD8+/FoxP3+ ratio and the presence of CD45R0+ T-lymphocytes were strongly associated with well-known favorable prognostic factors in endometrial cancer. Furthermore, high numbers of CD8+ T-lymphocytes and a high CD8+/FoxP3+ ratio were associated with a better disease free survival (DFS). High numbers of CD8+ T-lymphocytes and the presence of CD45R0+ T-lymphocytes were associated with a prolonged overall survival (OS). In multivariate analysis, high numbers of CD8+ T-lymphocytes had an independent prognostic impact for overall survival in the entire cohort (HR 0.48, 95% C.I. 0.26-0.89, p = 0.019) and in type II endometrial cancer (HR 0.17, 95% C.I. 0.08-0.36, p < 0.001). A high CD8+/FoxP3+ ratio was independently associated with improved survival in type I endometrial cancer (HR 0.44, 95% C.I. 0.23-0.84, p = 0.013). CD45R0+ lymphocytes were an independent factor for improved OS (HR 0.42, 95% C.I. 0.19-0.93, p = 0.033). Conclusion: This study shows that the presence of TIL is an independent prognostic factor in endometrial cancer and indicates an important role for the immune system in endometrial cancer. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Immunotherapy is acquiring a primary role in treating endometrial cancer (EC) with a relevant benefit for many patients. Regardless, patients progressing during immunotherapy or those who are resistant represent an unmet need. The mechanisms of immune resistance and escape need to be better investigated. Here, we review the major mechanisms of immune escape activated by the indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) pathway in EC and focus on potential therapeutic strategies based on IDO1 signaling pathway control. IDO1 catalyzes the first rate-limiting step of the so-called “kynurenine (Kyn) pathway”, which converts the essential amino acid l-tryptophan into the immunosuppressive metabolite l-kynurenine. Functionally, IDO1 has played a pivotal role in cancer immune escape by catalyzing the initial step of the Kyn pathway. The overexpression of IDO1 is also associated with poor prognosis in EC. These findings can lead to advantages in immunotherapy-based approaches as a rationale for overcoming the immune escape. Indeed, besides immune checkpoints, other mechanisms, including the IDO enzymes, contribute to the EC progression due to the immunosuppression induced by the tumor milieu. On the other hand, the IDO1 enzyme has recently emerged as both a promising therapeutic target and an unfavorable prognostic biomarker. This evidence provides the basis for translational strategies of immune combination, whereas IDO1 expression would serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in metastatic EC.},

Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the decomposition of complex tissues into functionally distinct cell types. Often, investigators wish to assign cells to cell types through unsupervised clustering followed by manual annotation or via ‘mapping’ to existing data. However, manual interpretation scales poorly to large datasets, mapping approaches require purified or pre-annotated data and both are prone to batch effects. To overcome these issues, we present CellAssign, a probabilistic model that leverages prior knowledge of cell-type marker genes to annotate single-cell RNA sequencing data into predefined or de novo cell types. CellAssign automates the process of assigning cells in a highly scalable manner across large datasets while controlling for batch and sample effects. We demonstrate the advantages of CellAssign through extensive simulations and analysis of tumor microenvironment composition in high-grade serous ovarian cancer and follicular lymphoma.},

   abstract = {© 2019 Funnell et al. Mutation signatures in cancer genomes reflect endogenous and exogenous mutational processes, offering insights into tumour etiology, features for prognostic and biologic stratification and vulnerabilities to be exploited therapeutically. We present a novel machine learning formalism for improved signature inference, based on multi-modal correlated topic models (MMCTM) which can at once infer signatures from both single nucleotide and structural variation counts derived from cancer genome sequencing data. We exemplify the utility of our approach on two hormone driven, DNA repair deficient cancers: breast and ovary (n = 755 samples total). We show how introducing correlated structure both within and between modes of mutation can increase accuracy of signature discovery, particularly in the context of sparse data. Our study emphasizes the importance of integrating multiple mutation modes for signature discovery and patient stratification, and provides a statistical modeling framework to incorporate additional features of interest for future studies.},

   abstract = {Abstract Background Most women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer have a relapse within 3 years after standard treatment with surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. The benefit of the oral poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib in relapsed disease has been well established, but the benefit of olaparib as maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed disease is uncertain. Methods We conducted an international, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of olaparib as maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed advanced (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III or IV) high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian-tube cancer (or a combination thereof) with a mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, or both (BRCA1/2) who had a complete or partial clinical response after platinum-based chemotherapy.

   abstract = {<h2>Summary</h2><p>High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) exhibits extensive malignant clonal diversity with widespread but non-random patterns of disease dissemination. We investigated whether local immune microenvironment factors shape tumor progression properties at the interface of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and cancer cells. Through multi-region study of 212 samples from 38 patients with whole-genome sequencing, immunohistochemistry, histologic image analysis, gene expression profiling, and T and B cell receptor sequencing, we identified three immunologic subtypes across samples and extensive within-patient diversity. Epithelial CD8+ TILs negatively associated with malignant diversity, reflecting immunological pruning of tumor clones inferred by neoantigen depletion, HLA I loss of heterozygosity, and spatial tracking between T cell and tumor clones. In addition, combinatorial prognostic effects of mutational processes and immune properties were observed, illuminating how specific genomic aberration types associate with immune response and impact survival. We conclude that within-patient spatial immune microenvironment variation shapes intraperitoneal malignant spread, provoking new evolutionary perspectives on HGSC clonal dispersion.</p>},

   abstract = {PURPOSE Cancers accumulate mutations over time, each of which brings the potential for recognition by the immune system. We evaluated T-cell recognition of the tumor mutanome in patients with ovarian cancer undergoing standard treatment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Tumor-associated T cells from 3 patients with ovarian cancer were assessed by ELISPOT for recognition of nonsynonymous mutations identified by whole exome sequencing of autologous tumor. The relative levels of mutations and responding T cells were monitored in serial tumor samples collected at primary surgery and first and second recurrence. RESULTS The vast majority of mutations (78/79) were not recognized by tumor-associated T cells; however, a highly specific CD8(+) T-cell response to the mutation hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-like protein 1 (HSDL1)(L25V) was detected in one patient. In the primary tumor, the HSDL1(L25V) mutation had low prevalence and expression, and a corresponding T-cell response was undetectable. At first recurrence, there was a striking increase in the abundance of the mutation and corresponding MHC class I epitope, and this was accompanied by the emergence of the HSDL1(L25V)-specific CD8(+) T-cell response. At second recurrence, the HSDL1(L25V) mutation and epitope continued to be expressed; however, the corresponding T-cell response was no longer detectable. CONCLUSION The immune system can respond to the evolving ovarian cancer genome. However, the T-cell response detected here was rare, was transient, and ultimately failed to prevent disease progression. These findings reveal the limitations of spontaneous tumor immunity in the setting of standard treatments and suggest a high degree of ignorance of tumor mutations that could potentially be reversed by immunotherapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Although tumor-infiltrating T cells have been documented in ovarian carcinoma, a clear association with clinical outcome has not been established. METHODS We performed immunohistochemical analysis of 186 frozen specimens from advanced-stage ovarian carcinomas to assess the distribution of tumor-infiltrating T cells and conducted outcome analyses. Molecular analyses were performed in some tumors by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS CD3+ tumor-infiltrating T cells were detected within tumor-cell islets (intratumoral T cells) in 102 of the 186 tumors (54.8 percent); they were undetectable in 72 tumors (38.7 percent); the remaining 12 tumors (6.5 percent) could not be evaluated. There were significant differences in the distributions of progression-free survival and overall survival according to the presence or absence of intratumoral T cells (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The five-year overall survival rate was 38.0 percent among patients whose tumors contained T cells and 4.5 percent among patients whose tumors contained no T cells in islets. Significant differences in the distributions of progression-free survival and overall survival according to the presence or absence of intratumoral T cells (P<0.001 for both comparisons) were also seen among 74 patients with a complete clinical response after debulking and platinum-based chemotherapy: the five-year overall survival rate was 73.9 percent among patients whose tumors contained T cells and 11.9 percent among patients whose tumors contained no T cells in islets. The presence of intratumoral T cells independently correlated with delayed recurrence or delayed death in multivariate analysis and was associated with increased expression of interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, and lymphocyte-attracting chemokines within the tumor. The absence of intratumoral T cells was associated with increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. CONCLUSIONS The presence of intratumoral T cells correlates with improved clinical outcome in advanced ovarian carcinoma.},
